    /// <c>WeaponTraitDef</c> carry a <c>WeaponTraitDefExtension</c> that swaps the
    /// weapon's whole graphic for a given base def; its comp resolves the
    /// highest-priority matching override and writes the result straight into
    /// <c>Thing.graphicInt</c> — the backing field <c>Thing.Graphic</c> returns —
    /// with no Harmony patch on the getter. So <em>once that comp has run</em>, the
    /// override is reachable through <c>Thing.Graphic</c> like any vanilla graphic.
    ///
    /// <para>The catch is <em>when</em> it runs: VEF only recomputes on equip and
    /// on load (and its trait scan is memoized in a private cache that our trait
    /// edits don't invalidate). Neither fires during our preview, and neither fires
    /// for a weapon that stays put while we mutate its trait list.
